# LLM Attention Dynamics

A tool for visualizing and comparing how different LLMs allocate attention during text generation. The project provides an interactive web interface where you can input prompts and observe, how two different models attend to various parts of your input as they generate responses, with slider bars to let you see at each step how the attention scores allocated to each prompt token change.
